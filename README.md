Flight Delay Time Prediction using Ensemble Learning
This project focuses on predicting flight delay times using an ensemble learning approach. The flight data was processed to create a classification problem, with delay times binned into eight categories (0â€“7). A stacking ensemble model was implemented, combining four different classifiers to achieve robust predictions.

Features and Data Engineering
Selected Features:
Departure Information: Scheduled time, estimated time, and terminal.
Arrival Information: Arrival airport, scheduled arrival time, and terminal.
Airline Information: Airline name and flight number.
Delay Information: Actual delay calculated as the difference between scheduled and estimated departure times.
Feature Engineering:
Delay Minutes: Calculated as the difference between estimated and scheduled departure times, then binned into eight categories.
Missing Values Handling:
Numerical: Filled missing values (e.g., delay minutes) with 0, indicating no delay.
Categorical: Filled missing values with "unknown" to ensure data completeness.
Ensemble Learning Methodology
The model employs a stacking ensemble approach with the following components:

Base Models:
Logistic Regression:
Built from scratch using gradient descent and the sigmoid function.
Decision Tree:
Implemented with Gini impurity to determine the best splits.
Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Implemented from scratch with a linear kernel.
Naive Bayes:
Used Gaussian likelihood for feature distributions.
Meta-Model:
Logistic Regression:
Used to combine the predictions of the base models into the final output.
Why Stacking?
Stacking leverages the strengths of each base model:

Logistic Regression handles linearly separable data.
Decision Trees manage non-linear relationships.
SVMs are robust for classification tasks.
Naive Bayes is fast and efficient for probabilistic modeling.
By combining these models, the ensemble improves overall predictive performance.

Evaluation Metrics and Results
Metrics:
Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
F1-Score: A weighted average of precision and recall, useful for addressing class imbalance.
Model Performance:
Accuracy: 90.08%
F1-Score: 57.46%
The ensemble achieved high accuracy, demonstrating strong predictive performance. However, the lower F1-score indicates areas for improvement, particularly in handling imbalanced classes or difficult-to-predict instances.

Challenges and Solutions
Key Challenges:
Overflow in Logistic Regression:
Resolved by adjusting the learning rate and limiting iterations during gradient descent.
Divide by Zero in Naive Bayes:
Avoided by adding a small constant (epsilon) to the variance during likelihood calculations.
Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning for base models.
Exploring additional ensemble techniques like bagging or boosting.
Enhancing feature engineering for better class separation.
Conclusion
This project successfully implemented a stacking ensemble model for flight delay prediction, achieving over 90% accuracy. The ensemble approach effectively combined the strengths of multiple classifiers, but further optimization could improve the model's handling of complex and imbalanced cases.
